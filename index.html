			<p>I found a love for computers in boarding school, I would spend many if not all break times playing games
				and
				programming (then using Delphi). My interest in I.T. grew as I entered University to study a BSC I.T. to
				become a
				<span itemprop="jobTitle">Software Engineer</span>. During my degree I found like minded individuals and
				joined
				<strong><a href="http://www.redrubyit.co.za" class="color-ruby" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

				and I am so lucky to be doing something that
				I love. My goal is to continue learning all that I can and to live on the bleeding edge of tech until it
				bites me

						<p>While I was working on the CQT team, we had a Raspberry PI that was our build monitor. It was

							monitor. Eventually I recreated it in Angular 6. Ever since then our team's PI has been

							<strong>Hollard CQT</strong>
							<small>Johannesburg, South Africa</small>
						</h2>
						<p>CQT is an internal system to help Broker Consultants create quotes. We integrated into many
							services at Hollard. The team had quite a lot of say in the technologies used. The
							technology stack that we ended up going with (React frontend and C# MVC .Net Framework
							backend) caused us to spend a lot of time learning (mostly React) and we ended up with quite
							a bit of technical debt due to time constraints and pressure from business. We were one of
							the first teams in Hollard to have a fully automated CI / CD pipeline and we set the golden
							standard on how to do deployments at Hollard. I grew a lot in this project. In the beginning

						<p>I joined a team at Hollard Insurance in Parktown North, where I worked on their Customer App
							built with Xamarin. It was quite a tough fit as I did not have any real experience with
							Xamarin. This move was only temporary, as Hollard wanted me for a project that was to start
							soon after I joined. I learned a lot from working on that team and it sparked an interest in
							App Development. I went on to create the first version of TennoDex (Xamarin app with a C#
							.Net Core Api backend) in my spare time using what I had learned.</p>

				<p>I originally built this website while I was in university. I had very little understanding of html,
					css, and javascript. I mostly copy-pasted html with inline styles and grabbed javascript
					from Stack Overflow to make the site 'work'. Around the <small class="label label-kurt">19th
						November 2019</small>&nbsp;I started rebuilding the site with the intention of making it small,
					fast, SEO
					friendly and to apply as much of what I had learned onto the new site. I wrote a blog post about the
					redesign <strong><a href="https://blog.kurtlourens.com/kurtlourens-com-redesigned/" target="_blank"
